# Fuel Economy Analysis 🚗💨

### Overview
This project analyzes fuel economy trends across various vehicle types in the U.S. market. 
Data from the **U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)** is used to explore the relationships between
vehicle attributes such as engine displacement, model year, fuel type, and vehicle class, offering insights into how these factors influence fuel efficiency.

### Dataset 📊
- **Source**: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
- **Link**: [Dataset Link](https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/download.shtml)
- **Key Variables**:
    - displ: Engine displacement in liters
    - year: Model year of the vehicle
    - comb08: Combined fuel economy rating (MPG)
    - VClass: Vehicle size class (e.g., compact car, SUV)
    - fuelType1: Primary fuel type (e.g., gasoline, electric)
 
### Methodology 🛠️
- Conducted **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** using descriptive statistics and visualizations.
- Leveraged R libraries like ggplot2, dplyr, and tidyverse to uncover insights and trends.
- Utilized a **Generalized Additive Model (GAM)** to predict fuel economy based on displacement, year, and vehicle class.
 
### Tools & Technologies Used 🔧:
- **Languages**: R 🧑‍💻
- **Libraries**: ggplot2, dplyr, tidyverse
